## Regression
In this module, there is an introduction to simple linear, multiple linear and non-linear regression and their applications. You will also learn about model evaluation metrics for regression such as mean absolute error and mean squared error, as well as learning about two types of evaluation approaches: training and testing on the same dataset and train/test split. 

## Classification
In this module, learn about classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine. You will also learn about various evaluation metrics for classifiers such as the Jaccard index, F1-score and Log Loss.

## Clustering
In this module, you will learn about clustering approaches such as K-Means Clustering, Hierarchical Clustering and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). Clustering can be used for customer segmentation or grouping weather stations.Jaccard index, F1-score and Log Loss.
