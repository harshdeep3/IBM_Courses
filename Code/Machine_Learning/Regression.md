# Simple Linear Regression

Linear regression is the approximation of a linear model used to describe the relationship between two or more variable. There are dependent and independent variables. The dependent variable are depend on the independent variable, meaning the if the independent variable changes the dependent variable will also change. 

Simple Linear regression is when one independent variable is used to estimate a dependent variable. 

A linear regression problem can be shown as a graph, with x being the independent variable and y being the dependent variable. This allow us to draw a line of best fit. We find the bes coefficients for the line. In a line graph these can be described as the gradient and y-intercept.

Linear regression estimates the coefficients for the gradient and y-intercept by fitting to the data given. The best line is when the MSE is error the smallest. 

# Multiple Linear Regression

When more than one independent variable is present this multiple linear regression.
