# Clustering 
Clustering can group data (only unsupervised) based on the similarity of data to each other. 

A cluster is a group of objects that are similar to other objects in the cluster, and dissimilar to data points in other clusters.

Clustering can be used for:
* Exploratory data analysis
* Summary Generation
* Out-lier Detection
* Finding Duplication
* Pre_processing step
